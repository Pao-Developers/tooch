.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B memch
utility reads UTF-8 Simplified Chinese text from
.IR file ","
seperates them by Chinese punctuation into `segments', replaces every
alternating segment with blanks, displays the rest (punctuation is always
displayed and is not a part of segments), and asks the user for blanked
segments.  The program then checks whether the input matches the blanked
segments, turning the segment green if it matches, yellow if it does not match
but the subsequent retry is correct (unless if the input is blank), and red if
both the current try and the subsequent retry do not match.  After all input
attempts for the blank segment the segment text is also showed.  If
.IR line
is provided, only the line with the specified line number is used from
.IR filename "."

work for Chinese text. Please poke runxiyu if you know how to
display wide characters in ncurses.
