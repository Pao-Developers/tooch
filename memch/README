NAME
     memch

SYNOPSIS
     memch filename [line]

DESCRIPTION
     The memch utility reads UTF-8 Simplified Chinese text from file,
     seperates them by Chinese punctuation into `segments', replaces every
     alternating segment with blanks, displays the rest (punctuation is always
     displayed and is not a part of segments), and asks the user for blanked
     segments.	The program then checks whether the input matches the blanked
     segments, turning the segment green if it matches, yellow if it does not
     match but the subsequent retry is correct (unless if the input is blank),
     and red if both the current try and the subsequent retry do not match.
     After all input attempts for the blank segment the segment text is also
     showed.  If line is provided, only the line with the specified line
     number is used from filename.

BUGS
     Because of character width issues, the C version doesn't currently work
     for Chinese text. Please poke runxiyu if you know how to display wide
     characters in ncurses.

     Please do not use this program on files where there are more than 1000
     characters in one line. The behaviour on such an input file is undefined.
